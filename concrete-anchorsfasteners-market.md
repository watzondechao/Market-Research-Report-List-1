<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Anchors/Fasteners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Anchors/Fasteners</li><li>Adhesive Anchors/Fasteners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete anchors/fasteners market comprises two main types: mechanical anchors and adhesive anchors. Mechanical anchors rely on physical expansion or fastening within the concrete for stability, making them ideal for heavy loads and immediate use. They include varieties such as wedge, sleeve, and drop-in anchors. In contrast, adhesive anchors utilize chemical bonding agents to secure themselves within the concrete, providing strong hold and resistance to vibrations. These are particularly effective for applications requiring high strength and load-bearing capacities over time.</p></p>
