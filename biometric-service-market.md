<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biometric Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unimodal Mode</li><li>Multimodal Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biometric service market is divided into two main types: unimodal and multimodal modes. Unimodal systems utilize a single biometric trait, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, for identification and authentication. While simpler, they can be less secure and prone to errors. Multimodal systems, on the other hand, combine multiple biometric traits, enhancing accuracy and security by cross-verifying data. This makes multimodal solutions more robust against fraud, improving user reliability and offering better performance in various applications.</p></p>
