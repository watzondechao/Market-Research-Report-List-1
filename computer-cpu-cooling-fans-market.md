<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Computer CPU Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CPU cooling fan market primarily features two types: axial and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, providing direct airflow and high volume, making them suitable for cooling CPUs in compact systems. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, draw air in axially and expel it radially, creating higher pressure with lower airflow, ideal for efficient cooling in larger or more complex setups. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining optimal CPU temperatures and system performance.</p></p>
